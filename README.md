## Setup
**Clone or Download the Repository**

**Navigate to the Project Directory**

**Open the index.html File**
Open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.

**Add Images**
Make sure to place the images for the cards in a folder called `img` at the same level as `index.html`. The images should be named according to the card names (e.g., `aurelia.svg`, `react.svg`, etc.).

## How to Play
1. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its face.
2. Try to find a matching pair by flipping over two cards.
3. If the cards match, they will stay face-up. If not, they will flip back after a short delay.
4. Keep track of your matches and try to find all pairs!
5. Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and shuffle the cards.
